# Kotlin Immutable List IndexOutOfBoundsException

This repository demonstrates a common error in Kotlin: accessing an index beyond the bounds of an immutable list created using `listOf()`.  The `bug.kt` file contains code that attempts to access an index that doesn't exist, resulting in an `IndexOutOfBoundsException`. The `bugSolution.kt` provides a corrected version, showing how to handle this scenario safely.
